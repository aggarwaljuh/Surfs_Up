# surfs_up

## Purpose
The purpose of this study was to help the business owner to determine if having a year-around surf and ice cream shop is sustainable. We will provide data for temprature in both June and December. We provide the mean, max and min tempratures. 

## Results
Three key differences were:
1. There were lower number of temprature counts in December (1517) vs June (1700). 
2. The mean temprature in December is not substantally lower than June differing by about 4 degrees (71.0 vs 74.9).
3. The max temp in June is 85 which is close to what it is in December (83). This shows that overall the temprature is the same or very similar throughout the year.
